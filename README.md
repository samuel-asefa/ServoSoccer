## âš½ Servo Soccer
<p width="50%" position="relative">This Arduino project is based off penalty kicks (and shootouts) in soccer! It can be played with 2 players with <br>one as the goalie and the other as the penalty taker. However, beware which side you pick to defend as the <br>goalkeeper as your servo goalie won't be able to change direction after until the reset button is pressed!</p>

## ðŸ’» Code
Here is a brief overview of the code for this project!
- Lines 1-12: Initializing buttons, servo, and variables.
- Lines 13-20: Servo pin attachment and input pin type declaration.
- Lines 21-46: Main game loop
  -  Lines 22-24: Button states set with DigitalRead.
  -  Lines 25-43: Buttons states checked and game follows accordingly.
